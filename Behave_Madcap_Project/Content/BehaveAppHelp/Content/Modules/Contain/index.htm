        <p>This module adds the containment model to the Surface module. The containment model allows users to game out the resource complement needed to contain a spot fire. The spot fire can be a spot fire adjacent to a prescribed fire unit or an initial attack fire.</p>
        <h5><b>Assumptions of the Containment Model</b>
        </h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Fire is elliptically shaped.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The fuel types do not change along the fire perimeter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Each resource constructs line equally along both flanks of the fire.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Each resource will have the same production rate for the entire duration of the shift.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Most users will benefit by first calculating the total line production rate needed to contain the fire. While a future version of Behave will hopefully allow this approach, users can currently calculate this by selecting a broad range of inputs for the resource line production rate. In the following example, a resource line production rate of 10-100 ch/h with steps of 10 ch/h was used.</p>

        </p>
        <p>There are two outputs to focus on. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>First, the predicted flame length is less than 2 ft so any resource can be used, and a line construction offset is not needed. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Second, a total line production rate between 30-40 ch/h is needed to contain the fire. You're looking for that breakpoint between "Withdrawn" and "Contained". By returning to the Suppression tab in the Behave inputs, a range from 30-40 ch/h with a step of 1 can be used as the input for resource line production rate to determine the total line production rate for these conditions.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
