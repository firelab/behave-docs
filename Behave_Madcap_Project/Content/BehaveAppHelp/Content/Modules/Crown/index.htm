        </div>Crown Fire<p><img alt="" /></p><p>The CROWN module in BehavePlus includes models for spread rate and intensity (Byram 1959; Thomas 1963; Rothermel 1991), transition from surface to crown fire (Van Wagner 1977, 1989, 1993; Finney 1998; Scott and Reinhardt 2001), conditions for active crown fire (Van Wagner 1977) and fire type (Van Wagner 1993; Finney 1998; Scott and Reinhardt 2001). The models were developed independently and, although not specifically designed to work together, the CROWN module provides a means of modelling the range of fire behaviour (Finney 1998; Scott and Reinhardt 2001). Many important factors that affect crown fire are not included (Werth et al. 2011). It is especially important for a user to be aware of model limitations in predicting extreme fire behaviour (Cruz and Alexander 2010). The model for crown fire rate of spread is a simple correlation based on seven crown fires (Rothermel 1991). The inputs are only 20-ft wind speed and surface fuel moisture. The model does not utilise a description of either the surface or the crown fuels. It was designed to predict an average crown fire spread rate over several hours. Due to the nature of the model, spotting is included as a mechanism of spread. BehavePlus does not include a reduction to spread rate based on crown fraction burned as does FARSITE, which includes spotting as a separate influence in fire growth modelling (Van Wagner 1993; Finney 1998; Scott and Reinhardt 2001). As defined by Rothermel (1991), crown fire flame length is calculated using Thomas’ (1963) model. Flame length is a function of crown fireline intensity, which is computed using the same basic model that is used for surface fire (Byram 1959). Crown fireline intensity is found from crown fire rate of spread and heat per unit area from both crown and surface fuels. Whereas the contribution of surface fuels can be taken from the SURFACE module, BehavePlus also allows direct input from a table prepared by Rothermel (1991) using a Albini’s (1976b) burnout model to account for heavy fuel. Rothermel (1991) used Byram’s (1959) relationships to model power of the fire and power of the wind. The power ratio (PR) is an indication of whether the fire might be wind driven (PR , 1) or plume-dominated (PR . 1). Given the many influencing factors and unknowns in crown fire behaviour, the results are not to be taken as predictions. Rather these calculations are useful in encouraging a person to consider the possibility of extreme fire behaviour under low-wind conditions. Critical surface fireline intensity is the value required for a surface fire to transition to crown fire (Van Wagner 1977). Surface fireline intensity is either calculated using the models in the BehavePlus SURFACE module or directly specified by the user. In addition to a binary indication of transition (yes or no), the ratio of surface fireline intensity to critical surface fireline intensity (transition ratio, TR) quantifies the relationship. Although the magnitude of the dimensionless value has no specific interpretation, a value close to one indicates the need for more care in interpretation of results. The critical crown fire rate of spread is the rate at which a crown fire must spread to maintain itself as an active crown fire (Van Wagner 1977). Similar to TR, active ratio (AR) is the ratio of crown fire rate of spread to critical crown fire rate of spread. Fire type is based on the results of modelling conditions for transition to crown fire (TR) and for active crown fire (AR). A fire is categorised as ‘surface’ if TR , 1 and AR , 1; the fire is expected not to transition from surface to crown, and if it does it would not sustain as an active crown fire. The fire is ‘torching’ or ‘passive crown’ if TR . 1 and AR , 1; the fire makes the transition to crown fire but cannot spread as an active crown fire. The fire is ‘crowning’ or ‘active crown’ if TR . 1 and AR . 1; the fire makes the transition to crown fire and can spread as an active crown fire. The fire is labelled ‘conditional crown’ if TR , 1 and AR . 1; the model indicates that the fire will not transition to crown, but if it does, it could spread as an active crown fire.</p></body>
