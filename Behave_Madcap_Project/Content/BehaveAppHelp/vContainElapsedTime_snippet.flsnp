        <p>In the Surface/Contain module, the Elapsed Time is the period between a fire igniting and spreading and the fire being reported. For instance, on a prescribed fire the Elapsed Time is the amount of time between a spot fire igniting and spreading outside of the unit and resources reporting the spot fire.</p>
