        <h1 MadCap:conditions="BehaveApp.Title Exclude">Fire Area at Resource Arrival Time (CONTAIN)</h1>
        <p>Fire Area at Resource Arrival Time is the predicted area of a fire when the first resource arrives and begins suppression. When the Resource Arrival Time is 0 hours, this area is the same as the Fire Size at Report.</p>
        <p>Fire Area at Resource Arrival Time is calculated from the fire area (Fire Size at Report), shape (Length-to-Width Ratio), the Surface Rate of Spread (heading), and Resource Arrival Time.</p>
