        <h1 MadCap:conditions="BehaveApp.Title Exclude">Resource Arrival Time (CONTAIN)</h1>
        <p>Resource Arrival Time is the time that has elapsed from when the fire was reported until the containment resource arrives at the fire and begins fireline construction. All activities such as scouting and briefing that occur before line construction begins should be included in Resource Arrival Time.</p>
        <p>For onsite resources, you need to consider the time it will take resources to access the spot fire or slopover. For offsite resources, consider potential drive time, briefing, scouting, and access.</p>
