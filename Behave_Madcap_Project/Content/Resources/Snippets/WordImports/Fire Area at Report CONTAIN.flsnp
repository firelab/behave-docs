        <p>Fire Area at Report is the estimated area of a fire when it is first reported. For a prescribed fire, this is the estimated size of the slopover or spot fire outside the unit at the time it is detected by holding or aviation resources or a lookout. For a wildfire, this is the estimated size of the fire when it is reported or when IA resources arrive at the scene.</p>
