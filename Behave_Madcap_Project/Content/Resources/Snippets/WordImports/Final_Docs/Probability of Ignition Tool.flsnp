        <p>Probability of Ignition (0-100%) gives you an idea of how likely an ember is to start a fire based on site conditions. This tool only calculates Probability of Ignition from a firebrand or ember. Probability of Ignition is based on 1-h Fuel Moisture, Air Temperature, and Fuel Shading from the Sun.</p>
        <p>Fuel Shading from the Sun includes shading from both clouds <span class="span_1">and</span> overstory vegetation. </p>
