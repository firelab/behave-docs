The image below displays crown ratios for 40%, 60%, and 80%. It can be estimated in the field.</p><p><img src="../../../../../../Resources/Images/CrownRatio_v6.png" alt="Comparison of different crown ratios. Left to right, 80% with fullest crown down to 40% with least full crown." /></p><p>The image below shows two ponderosa pine stands. The photo on the left is a single story stand with a crown ratio of approximately 70%. In the photo on the right, there are two distinct age classes. If you wanted to calculate the probability of mortality for the overstory, the crown ratio would be about 40-50% whereas the saplings would be 80-90%. </p><p><img src="../../../../../../Resources/Images/CrownRation_PIPO.png" alt="Comparison of crown ratio in single story versus two story stand." /></p><p>Consider all proposed treatments that will occur prior to burning for prescribed fire planning. The photo below shows a stand following a timber harvest. The crown ratio following a timber harvest may be quite different than the crown ratio prior to harvest. If trees will be pruned prior to burning, consider the cutting specifications to estimate the crown ratio.</p><p><img src="../../../../../../Resources/Images/CrownRatio_treated.png" alt="An example of crown ratio in a treated stand." /></p><h2>Crown Ratio is Used to Calculate </h2><ul><li><p>Tree Crown Length Scorched</p></li></ul></div></body>
