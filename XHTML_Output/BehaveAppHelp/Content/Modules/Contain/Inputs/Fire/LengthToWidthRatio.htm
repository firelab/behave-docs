            <p>Length-to-Width Ratio (SURFACE, CROWN)<p>Length-to-Width Ratio describes the appearance of an elliptically shaped fire. Fires burning under higher wind speeds have a larger length-to-width ratio and thus will be long and narrow. It is affected by both wind speed and slope in a surface fire, which are combined to calculate the effective wind speed. Slope is not factored into the length-to-width ratio for a crown fire; the only input is 20-ft wind speed.</p><p>It is calculated as Heading Spread Distance plus the Backing Spread Distance divided by the Flanking Spread Distance. The image below shows calculated length-to-width ratio for surface fire (left) and crown fire (right) for a variety of effective wind speeds. To demonstrate the effect of wind on fire shape, the length is constant for all fires in the image.</p><p><img src="../../../../../../Resources/Images/Length-to-Width-Ratio.jpg" alt="Ellipses of various sizes. On the left, for surface fire effective windspeeds of 1 - 15 and length to width ratios of 1.3 - 4.8 increase as the ellipses decrease in size. On the right, for crown fire, effective windspeeds of 0-30 and length to width radios of 1-0.2, with windspeeds increasing and length to width ratio decreasing as the ellipses decrease in size.
