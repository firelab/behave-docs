            <p>Resource Name is a one-word identifier for each containment resource. The resource name must be a single word without any blanks or tabs. However, hyphens and underscores can be used. A few examples are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Engine1</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>IHC_1</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>T2_Crew_2</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Dozer-1</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="div" id="behaveplus:contain:input:suppression:resources:resource_arrival_time:help">
            <h1 class="topictitle">Resource Arrival Time</h1>
            <div class="prolog"><span class="metadata">behaveplus:contain:input:suppression:resources:resource_arrival_time:help</span>
            </div>
            <p>Resource Arrival Time is the time that has elapsed from when the fire was reported until the containment resource arrives at the fire and begins fireline construction. All activities such as scouting and briefing that occur before line construction begins should be included in Resource Arrival Time.</p>
            <p>For onsite resources, you need to consider the time it will take resources to access the spot fire or slopover. For offsite resources, consider potential drive time, briefing, scouting, and access.</p>

        <div class="div" id="behaveplus:contain:input:suppression:resources:resource_line_production_rate:help">
            <h1 class="topictitle">Resource Line Production Rate</h1>
            <div class="prolog"><span class="metadata">behaveplus:contain:input:suppression:resources:resource_line_production_rate:help</span>
            </div>
            <p>Resource Line Production Rate is the average, sustained rate at which a resource can build fireline. The contain model divides the production rate equally between the two flanks of the fire. For example, a tractor-plow constructs fireline on flat ground at a rate of 120 ch/h. The model assumes that the tractor-plow constructs line at 60 ch/h on each flank.</p>
            <p>Guidelines for Resource Line Production Rates were first developed in the 1970s, and rates for hand crews were updated in 2011. Use better data for line production rates if locally available, and document assumptions for any of the changes made in the “Notes” section of the worksheet.</p>

        <div class="div" id="behaveplus:contain:input:suppression:resources:resource_duration:help">
            <h1 class="topictitle">Resource Duration</h1>
            <div class="prolog"><span class="metadata">behaveplus:contain:input:suppression:resources:resource_duration:help</span>
            </div>
            <p>Resource Duration is the length of time that a given containment resource can sustain its line production rate for the entire shift. A resource begins line construction at the specified Resource Arrival Time, builds line at its specified Resource Line Production Rate, and stops building line when its Resource Duration has been met. Resources are added to the model based on arrival time until the fire is contained, or the fire is predicted to have escaped regardless of resources still in travel status.</p>
            <p>There is some guesswork when selecting the timeframe to use for Resource Duration as you don't know the exact time during the burn period that a spot or slopover will occur. Use a value that you can justify and use the Notes section to explain your rationale for documentation.</p>
