            </div>
            <p>Contain Status is the final outcome of initial attack efforts. There are three possible scenarios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contained</b> – one or more of the initial attack resources successfully contained the fire.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Withdrawn</b> – the resources constructed fireline and may have been gaining on the fire, butwere unable to work long enough to contain it. The fire may be successfully contained by increasing the Resource Duration or adding additional resources.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Escaped</b> – the selected resources were unable to contain the fire. Additional resources will be needed to meet containment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&#160;</p>

        <div class="div" id="behaveplus:contain:output:fire:containment:contained_area:help">
            <h1 class="topictitle">Contained Area</h1>
            <div class="prolog"><span class="metadata">behaveplus:contain:output:fire:containment:contained_area:help</span>
            </div>
            <p>Contained Area is the area enclosed by the fireline (Fireline Constructed). If the Line Construction Offset is greater than zero, this area is larger than the predicted fire area at containment. </p>
            <p>The contained area is not equivalent to Fire Area in the Surface module.</p>

        <div class="div" id="behaveplus:contain:output:fire:containment:time_from_report:help">
            <h1 class="topictitle">Time from Report</h1>
            <div class="prolog"><span class="metadata">behaveplus:contain:output:fire:containment:time_from_report:help</span>
            </div>
            <p>Time from Report is the time that has elapsed from when the fire was reported until it was either successfully contained or it has escaped. A fire is predicted to escape when specified resources are unsuccessful in lining the fire because they have hit the Resource Duration.</p>
            <p>The image below shows the timeline for the outputs and inputs used in the containment model. In this example, the single resource was not able to contain the fire.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This can be solved by adding additional resources which increases the total line production rate. The timeline below is for multiple resources. Another way to potentially contain the fire is to increase the Resource Duration.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Fireline Constructed is the total length of fireline constructed by all resources at the time the fire was contained, the Resource Duration has been exceeded, or the fire was predicted to have escaped.</p>
            <p><b>If the fire is successfully contained</b>: </p>
