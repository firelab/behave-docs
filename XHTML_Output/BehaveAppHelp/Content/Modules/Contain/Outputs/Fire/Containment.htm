            </div>
            <p>Contain Status is the final outcome of initial attack efforts. There are three possible scenarios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contained</b> – one or more of the initial attack resources successfully contained the fire.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Withdrawn</b> – the resources constructed fireline and may have been gaining on the fire, butwere unable to work long enough to contain it. The fire may be successfully contained by increasing the Resource Duration or adding additional resources.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Escaped</b> – the selected resources were unable to contain the fire. Additional resources will be needed to meet containment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&#160;</p>

            <div class="prolog"><span class="metadata">behaveplus:contain:output:fire:containment:contained_area:help</span>
            </div>
            <p>Contained Area is the area enclosed with the fireline (Fireline Constructed). If the Line Construction Offset is greater than zero, this area is larger than the predicted fire area at containment. If the fire is predicted to escape, the Contained Area is -1. </p>
            <p>The contained area is not equivalent to Fire Area in the SURFACE module.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Time from Report is the time that has elapsed from when the fire was reported until it was either successfully contained or it has escaped. A fire is predicted to escape when specified resources are unsuccessful in lining the fire because they have hit the Resource Duration.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Fireline Constructed is the total length of fireline constructed by all resources at the time the fire was contained, the Resource Duration has been exceeded, or the fire was predicted to have escaped.</p>
            <p>If the fire is successfully contained, Fireline Constructed is the total length of line constructed by all resources at the time of containment.</p>
            <p>If containment is not successful, Fireline Constructed is the total length of line constructed by all resources at the time the last available resource ends work on the fire.</p>

            <p>The Containment Diagram depicts the final fire size and final containment status. It also shows constructed fireline at the time the fire was either contained, or when it has escaped initial attack because your selected resources are sissies that are taking a nap near the fireline. </p>
