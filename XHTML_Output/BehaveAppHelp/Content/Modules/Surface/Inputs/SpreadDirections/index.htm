        <p>Direction of Interest is a unique input displayed in the <i>Spread Directions</i> tab in the Surface module when Direction of Interest is selected as the direction of spread in the outputs. The Direction of Interest ranges from 30-330 degrees in relation to upslope. Within 30 degrees of upslope (331-29 degrees) you can calculate heading fire with no correction.</p>
        <p>In the scenario below, there is a south wind so slope and wind are aligned (black and blue lines labeled S and W, respectively). There is a whitebark pine stand (WBP) on the ridge to the northeast above the fire. To calculate fire behavior in the direction of the WBP stand, you would select a Direction of Interest of approximately 40 degrees. This will allow you to calculate fire behavior between a heading and flanking fire.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In Behave 7, the output diagram will look similar to the image below with the inputs described above. In addition to showing the direction of interest, the graph will also display heading (max spread), flanking, and backing.</p>

        </p>
        <p>You can use Direction of Interest when slope and wind are ALIGNED or when slope and wind are NOT ALIGNED.</p>

        <p>Spread Direction is the direction of fire spread for which rate of spread and flame length are calculated. It can be heading, backing, flanking, or somewhere in between (direction of interest).</p>

        <p>There are three input options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="span_1">Heading:</span> Fire behavior is calculated for the direction of maximum spread.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="span_1">Heading, Backing, and Flanking:</span>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Heading fire is moving in the direction of maximum spread.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Flanking fire is defined mathematically as fire spread that is 90<sup>o</sup> from the head fire at a point on the widest part of the ellipse.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Backing fire is fire spread that is 180<sup>o</sup> from the head fire.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="span_1">Direction of Interest:</span> Users can select any direction of spread along the perimeter.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Direction of Maximum Spread is always calculated for the head of the fire, regardless of the selection made for the remainder of the calculations.</p>
