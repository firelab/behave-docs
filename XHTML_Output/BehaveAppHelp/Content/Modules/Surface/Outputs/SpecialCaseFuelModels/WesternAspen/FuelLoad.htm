            <p>Total Fuel Load is the amount of fuel in all six fuel load classes. Five of these classes are defined in the fuel model parameters. The sixth (dead herbaceous fuel) is calculated during fuel load transfer for dynamic fuel models only. <span class="span_1">Note:</span> <span class="span_2">1000-h fuel is not included in the calculation of fire behavior.</span></p>
            <p>Dead Fuel Load is the amount of dead fuel in the fuel model. There are three size classes: 1-hour, 10-hour, and 100-hour. The name indicates approximately how long it takes for the fuel moisture for a given size class to reach equilibrium with its environment.</p>
