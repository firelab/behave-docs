        <p>The fuel models have been grouped by fuel type to help users sort the fuel model list. The color next to each fuel model helps users identify if it is a standard, Mediterranean, Southern California, or species specific fuel model. </p>
        <p>While we cannot give advice on whether a standard or Mediterranean fuel model is more appropriate for your area, incorporating multiple types of fuel models allows users to evaluate the fire behavior outputs and determine which may be the best fit based on observed fire behavior and experience.</p>
        <h5><b>Standard Fuel Models</b> (Developed for the US by Anderson and Scott and Burgan)</h5>
        <p>The standard fuel models include the 13 fuel models described by <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr122.pdf" target="_blank">Anderson (1982)</a> and the 40 fuel models described by <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/pubs_series/rmrs/gtr/rmrs_gtr153.pdf" target="_blank">Scott and Burgan (2005)</a>. </p>
        <p><u>13 Fuel Models</u>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The 13 fuel models were developed for the height of the fire season. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><u>40 Fuel Models</u>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The 40 fuel models were developed to create more choices for underrepresented regions of the U.S. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>One important difference is that the 40 fuel models include dynamic fuel models. The dynamic fuel models are those that have herbaceous (grass and forb) fuel loading. As these plants cure between 120 to 30% fuel moisture, the fuel load transfers from the live herbaceous to the dead herbaceous fuel load (known as fuel load transfer). You can test the results by selecting a dynamic fuel model in Behave and using live herbaceous fuel moisture values of 30% and 120%.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>These fuel models are available in the operational fire behavior modeling systems including Behave, FlamMap, FARSITE, WFDSS, and IFTDSS.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5><b>Mediterranean Fuel Models</b> (Developed for Portugal by Fernandes et al.)</h5>
        <p>The Mediterranean fuel models are a set of 18 custom fuel models developed for Portugal. Each has been assigned a fuel model code based on the heat per unit area output.</p>
        <h5><b>Chaparral &amp; Coastal Sage Scrub</b> (Developed for Southern California by Weise)</h5>
        <p>Five custom shrub fuel models have been developed for chaparral and chamise in Southern California and published by <a href="https://www.frames.gov/documents/behaveplus/publications/Weise_1997_ResourceManagement_SprSum.pdf" target="_blank">Weise (1997)</a>. Each has been assigned a fuel model code based on the heat per unit area output.</p>

        <p><b>Species Specific Fuel Models</b>
        </p>
        <p>This set of fuel models were called Special Case Fuel Models in BehavePlus. </p>
