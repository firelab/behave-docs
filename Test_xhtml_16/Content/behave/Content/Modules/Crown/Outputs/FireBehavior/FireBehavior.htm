Fuel moisture, wind speed, slope, and fuel model are held constant and are assumed uniform. If you run SURFACE and CROWN together, outputs will be identified by fire type: surface, torching, or active crown fire.</p><p>Surface Rate of Spread is estimated using Rothermel's (1972, 1983) surface fire spread model. Surface fuel includes litter, grass, brush, and other dead and live vegetation within about 6 feet (1.8 meters) of the ground.</p><p>Crown Rate of Spread (Rothermel 1991; Scott and Reinhardt 2001) is the forward rate of spread for a fire through the crown. The crown fire spread model is a simple correlation between spread rates from several historical crown fires and calculations from Rothermel's surface spread model. It does not include a description of either the surface or crown fuel. Surface spread rate calculates for crown are based on fuel model 10.</p>Direction of Spread<p>By default, BehavePlus calculates rate of spread in the direction of maximum spread (heading fire). For surface fire, you can identify the direction of fire spread in any direction, including heading, flanking, and backing.</p><ul><li>Heading fire is calculated in the direction of maximum spread.</li><li>Backing fire is 180o from heading.</li><li>Flanking fire is 90o from heading and is calculated at the widest part of the ellipse.</li></ul><p><img alt="" /></p><p>For more information on fire spread direction options, see Fire Spread Directions.</p>Rate of Spread is Used to Calculate<ul><li>Fire Area</li><li>Fire Perimeter</li></ul></p></div><div class="div" id="behaveplus:crown:output:fire_type:fire_behavior:flame_length:help"><h1 class="topictitle">Heading Flame Length</h1><div class="prolog"><span class="metadata">behaveplus:surface:output:fire_behavior:surface_fire:heading:heading_flame_length:help behaveplus:crown:output:fire_type:fire_behavior:flame_length:help behaveplus:surface:input:spot:hidden:flame-length:flame-length:help behaveplus:surface:input:spot:surface-fire-flame-length:heading-flame-length:help</span></div><p>Flame Length (SURFACE)<p>Flame length is the distance from the middle of the flaming front at the base of the fire to the average tip of the flame. Wind and slope will both cause a flame to tilt. Flame length is a common metric used in the field as it is readily observable. It is related to fireline intensity.</p><p><img alt="" /></p><p>Flame lengths vary with location on a fire, with heading fire having the longest flame lengths and backing fire the shortest flame lengths.</p>Flame Length is Used to Calculate<ul><li>Spotting Distance</li><li>Crown Fire Type</li></ul><p><img alt="" /></p></p></div><div class="div" id="behaveplus:crown:output:fire_type:fire_behavior:active-crown-fireline-intensity:help"><h1 class="topictitle">Heading Fireline Intensity</h1><div class="prolog"><span class="metadata">behaveplus:crown:output:fire_type:fire_behavior:active-crown-fireline-intensity:help behaveplus:surface:output:fire_behavior:surface_fire:heading:fireline-intensity:help</span></div><p>Fireline Intensity (SURFACE)<p>Fireline intensity is the amount of heat released per foot of fire front per second. The measurement extends one foot into the flaming zone by definition. It's a useful metric to evaluate the difficulty of containing a fire. Fireline intensity is a function of rate of spread and heat per unit area.</p><p>Fireline intensity and flame length are related to the heat felt by a person standing next to the flames.</p>Fireline Intensity is Used to Calculate<ul><li>Flame Length</li></ul><p><img alt="" /></p></p></div></div>
