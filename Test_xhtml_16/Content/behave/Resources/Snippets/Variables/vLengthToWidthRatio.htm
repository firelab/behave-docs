            <p>Length-to-Width Ratio (SURFACE, CROWN)<p>Length-to-Width Ratio describes the appearance of an elliptically shaped fire. Fires burning under higher wind speeds have a larger length-to-width ratio and thus will be long and narrow. It is affected by both wind speed and slope in a surface fire, which are combined to calculate the effective wind speed. Slope is not factored into the length-to-width ratio for a crown fire; the only input is 20-ft wind speed.</p><p>It is calculated as Heading Spread Distance plus the Backing Spread Distance divided by the Flanking Spread Distance. The image below shows calculated length-to-width ratio for surface fire (left) and crown fire (right) for a variety of effective wind speeds. To demonstrate the effect of wind on fire shape, the length is constant for all fires in the image.</p><p><img alt="" />
